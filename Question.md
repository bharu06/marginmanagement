Requirements:
- Use Spring Framework to build the RESTful API
- Use in-memory H2 database
- Design and implement the RESTful API endpoints to perform the following tasks:
    1. Upload a margin CSV file (csv example attached). POST /upload
       a. Validate as below:
       For Comment: Ignore/Skip this column from uploading
       Instruction: String
       Base Ccy: String length = 3. I.E: USD
       Term Ccy: String length = 3. i.E: SGD
       Trader Tier: Integer >= 0
       From Amount: Integer >= 0
       To Amount: Integer >= 0
       Bid Operator: "-" or "+"
       Bid Modifier: 6 dps number
       Ask Operator: "-" or "+"
       Ask Modifier: 6 dps number
       Remarks: String
       b. Upload a new file will erase current data in database and replace it with the new file content.
       c. Row order should be maintained in database. (using margin_order column)
    2. Download current margins as CSV. GET /download
    3. Find margin endpoint. POST /find
       a. Using POST method with input payload as below:
       "instruction"
       "baseCcy"
       "termCcy"
       "traderTier"
       "amount"
       b. 	Return the FIRST matched column (by margin_order column) with the input value.			
       Special codition, If in Database:
        - instruction = "*" => matched to any input "instruction"
        - base_ccy = "*" => matched to any input "baseCcy"
        - term_ccy = "*" => matched to any input "termCcy"
        - trader_tier = 0 => matched to any input "traderTier"
        - "amount" must be within range of from_amount and to_amount, if from_amount = to_amount = 0 => matched to any input "amount"
- Give instruction using postman on how to use the API. (Bonus)
